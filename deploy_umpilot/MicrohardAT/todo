Using a jump host for cofiguration:


ssh utilidata@jnx22u0011 -L1222:192.168.168.1:22 -L2223:192.168.168.1:2223 -L2222:192.168.168.1:2222


Create IMEI / SIMID table:

for F in mhdb/*_log; do echo $F $( grep -A 1 -m 1 'IMEI.*8' $F | strings ); done


# Change Ethernet port to 100 MBit Half-Duplex!

# Read IMEI & ICCID (called SIMID in the microhard router)

# Minimal secure config when going online:

## Change Password

## Change SSH port (allow tunneling?)

# Disable WebUI (or no remote access to it? disable HTTP & FTP? HTTPS needed for IO2!)

# Deposit SSH key? (secure password for now)

# Activate NTP

# Configure Port Forward(s)
# Allow "remote access" (to enable port forward)

# remote syslog to jetson (fixed IP)



# AT comamnds missing/to inquire about:
## install/manage SSH keys
## See uptime & description (system information page) (description is always myLTECube-CAT4, btw!)
## Upload configuration file?
## Cat4Wifi doesn't have AT+MMDNS (?) To be confirmed!!
##    AT+MMDNSPIPP - exact meaning, also vs. AT+MNLANDNS (which is part of Cat4Wifi as well)
## <Use Carrier DNS>       : 0 - Enable, 1 - Disbale  <<< notice "Disbale" typo !!
##  AT+MSWEBUI=<Mode>                            when <Mode>=3
## Note        : Not require AT&W    <<<< Contradicts LTECube-CAT4.Manual.v1.2.1.pdf !!!!
## UserDevice> AT+MSWEBUI=2,4443 <== This doesn't seem to take effect, even after AT&W ! Trying unit reboot... with AT+MSREB
##  ==> Doesn't stick after reboot either on CAT12. Works on CAT4, and later also worked on CAT4, weird


#
## Test reset to manufacturer defaults !! => works

## Command to set the time zone? (useful for less confusing syslog to jetson)

## access to busybox? (e.g. to query ARP table etc. etc.)

### Todo:

# Try nmap on public IP, other PenTesting
##	(Also do that on jetson!)



### Understand IO2 behaviour during reset, and potentially adjust cicruit on the 1000-units to avoid reset when Microhard does wathcdog,
# Or increase watchdog timeout? (Is there an AT command for that yet?)
# Since no AT command exists yet, rebooting router to reboot jetson in case of hang a valid option for now?


### Question for Microhard:
# The "preconfig" service, does it store our desired settigns into the NVRAM? i.e. will AT+MSRTF reset to these settings?
